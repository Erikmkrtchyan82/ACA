Basic Thread Creation
- Objective: Familiarize yourself with creating threads.
- Instructions:
  * Write a C program that creates three threads.
  * Each thread should print a message, including its thread ID, to indicate it is running (e.g., "Thread X is running").
  * Ensure the main thread waits for each of the threads to complete using pthread_join.
- Expected Output: Each thread prints a message, and the program exits only after all threads are complete.
