Array Processing with Threads
- Objective: Practice dividing an array processing task among multiple threads.
- Instructions:
  * Create an array of integers with a few values.
  * Write a function that calculates the sum of part of this array.
  * Use two threads: assign each half of the array to a different thread.
  * Each thread should calculate the sum of its half and print it.
- Expected Output: Two separate partial sums printed by each thread.
