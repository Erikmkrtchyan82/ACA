Calculating Square of Numbers in Parallel
- Objective: Demonstrate simple tasks that can run in parallel.
- Instructions:
  * Create an array of integers (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).
  * For each number in the array, create a thread that calculates its square and prints the result (e.g., "Square of 2 is 4").
  * Wait for all threads to finish before the main program exits.
- Expected Output: Each thread prints the square of its assigned number.
