Printing Numbers with Threads
- Objective: Practice thread creation and task division without synchronization.
- Instructions:
  * Write a program that creates three threads.
  * Each thread should print numbers from 1 to 5, along with its thread ID.
  * Observe that the order of printing may vary between runs, showing the concurrent execution.
- Expected Output: Each thread prints numbers from 1 to 5, but in potentially varying orders.
