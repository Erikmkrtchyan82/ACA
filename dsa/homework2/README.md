1) Design and implement algorithm for iterative pre-order traversal. So
given a node, if finds the pre-order next node.
Reminder: during preorder traversal,
•at first we mention root node, then
•do recursive pre-order traversal of left subtree (if present), and
finally
•do recursive pre-order traversal of right subtree (if present).
2) Write a function which will calculate "balanceness" of provided Binary
tree. Balanceness here is the ratio between depth of the leaf closest to
root and depth of the leaf farthest from root.
