1) Create open-addressing hash table with around M=500 cells. Insert
around 250-400 randomly generated values into it. Show effect of
primary clustering. For that, write another function which prints load of
the table on one line. An occupied cell can be printed with astrisk ('*'),
while for empty cell whitespace (' ') can be used.

2) Write a function which will print lengths of all runs, in given open-
addressing hash table. Reminder, a run is a cyclic range, where all cells
are occupied.

3) Implement removal from open-addressing hash table.
